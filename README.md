# Interactive-App-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-System-Using-Python
In this project, I developed a menu-driven system that stores app-related data such as ratings, reviews, installs, size, and price. The system allows users to edit the data, perform statistical analysis, and visualize the data using different types of graphs like bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, histograms, and stem plots.
🔹 Key Learnings:
 • Data handling using Pandas
 • Statistical analysis of data
 • Data visualization using Matplotlib
 • Logic building and user interaction in Python
🔧 Technologies Used:
 Python | Pandas | Matplotlib
This project helped me gain practical experience in data analysis and visualization.
 Excited to learn more and build advanced projects in the future! 💻📊
